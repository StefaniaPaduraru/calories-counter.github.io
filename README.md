# Calorie Counter Project

This project is part of the JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures (Beta) course offered by freeCodeCamp. You can find more information about the course at [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/).

## Overview

The Calorie Counter project focuses on applying JavaScript algorithms and data structures to create a functional calorie counting application. Throughout the course of this project, I gained valuable experience in validating user input, performing calculations based on that input, and dynamically updating the interface to display the results.

## What I Learned

- Validating user input in JavaScript.
- Implementing calculations based on user-provided data.
- Dynamically updating the user interface to display real-time results.
